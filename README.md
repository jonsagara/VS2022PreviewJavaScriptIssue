# Bug when pasting into a jQuery selector

I originally [reported this as an issue on Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Trying-to-paste-a-string-into-a-jQuery-s/10016857).

They closed it as a [duplicate of this TypeScript GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/48006).

On 2022-06-03, I installed TypeScript 4.7.3 and verified that the issue is fixed.

This repository is now archived.
